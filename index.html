            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> I graduated from FIT as a Fashion Business Major. I was a Merchandise Planner for 5 years. I did not
                find
                happiness in this type of career. I decided to dabble in code after talking to my younger brother
                who is
                in
                Engineering. I realized I was happiest learning to code and creating as well as seeing my creations
                visually
                almost
                immediatly. I love that code is universal and there is always a solution to your problem. The answer
                can
                be
                found through plenty of resources and learnings. I want to create through code and continue feeling
                that
                sense
                of accomplishment when my code works or when I
                have solved a hard problem.
            </p>

            <p> To pursue my dreams of becoming a software developer, I have decided to join <a
                    href="https://www.thinkful.com/"> Thinkful </a> as a student!</p>

            <p>I am excited to start my journey and collaborate with others to learn, grow, and build!</p>
